                    <p>
                        I am a web developer with a passion for creating clean, user-friendly websites and web applications.
                        With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I enjoy building both front-end and back-end solutions.
                        When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about new technologies, reading tech blogs, and working on personal projects.
                    </p>
